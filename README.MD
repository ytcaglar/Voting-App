# Voting App | Beginner Level .Net Core Path [www.patika.dev]

Hello, everyone. In this project, I tried to make a Voting App. In the application, you can vote categories. But to vote, you need to register. After that, you can vote. Also, each user can only vote one category.

## Main Menu :

![vote-main](https://github.com/ytcaglar/Voting-App/assets/93604446/7fc5eca4-aef2-4f66-921e-fe0ec658628b)

## Register Menu - Vote Menu :

![register-vote](https://github.com/ytcaglar/Voting-App/assets/93604446/c310670a-8961-418d-9f99-3917f116251f)

![vote-result](https://github.com/ytcaglar/Voting-App/assets/93604446/c7dbed65-2cfe-44db-824e-27c1cd24cd25)


## I wish everyone success. Thank you...
